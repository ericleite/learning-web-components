      <p class="bio">I am chemical engineer turned web developer. I have always been interested in technology and trying new things, so after my initial college graduation plans didn't work out, I made the leap to web development and moved to California to work as a User Interface Engineer. For fun, I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, and skiing. And when I'm not being active, I enjoy introspective art and entertainment. I also enjoy learning about all things science and technology, from biology to machine learning.</p>
